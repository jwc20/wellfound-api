This is an opportunity to have an outsized impact on our product, our culture, and to build something meaningful for families. \n\nScrappiness and dedication to our mission are the traits that will set candidates apart at this stage; years of experience or specific skills are far less important to us right now.  We need someone who is excited to get in the trenches with us and do everything possible to help us execute on the Kinsome vision.\n\nIf you, or an engineer you know, thrives in the uncertainty and chaos of early stage startup life and likes to move fast, please reach out to us at team@kinsome.com.\n\n**Why join Kinsome**\nWork on a meaningful problem. We\u2019re working to build stronger bonds between grandkids and grandparents, to help fight some of the forces leading to the break up of intergenerational families. We\u2019re also lucky to have raised funding from friends and Angels that believe in our team and are strongly aligned with this mission.\nMove fast. Our only goal at this stage is to build a product that families love, which means lots of experimentation and lots of shipping.\nSolve difficult product challenges. We\u2019re trying to reach kids and seniors\u2014two groups who are typically underserved by tech. This comes with a lot of fun, novel design and accessibility challenges.\nOwn the product. For a team our size (you\u2019ll be one of two engineers, along with yours truly), we all take full responsibility and ownership for what we build.\nCollaborate. We believe building great products is a team sport, and we try to look for thoughtful, curious, and low-ego collaborators. \nUse cutting-edge tech. We believe that some of the recent advancements in AI are an enabling technology to bridge the divide between grandkids and grandparents. As a new company, we\u2019re also using a small, modern tech stack (React Native, NextJS, Supabase) which you would help shape over time.\n\n**Things you should know**\nIt\u2019s a leap of faith. Startups are incredibly hard and, as an angel-backed startup, we need to be extremely capital efficient until we find true product-market fit. Compensation will skew towards equity compared to the broader tech market\u2013we believe in sharing success as a team.\nWe\u2019re based in Boston. We\u2019ve spent most of my career working remotely, however, we feel that collaborating in-person gives us the best chance to spark new ideas and helps to smooth out some of the emotional roller-coaster of trying to build something new. We\u2019ve got an awesome office space in Beacon Hill, where we work together a few times a week.",

In particular, we\u2019re excited to be spending our time working in the following areas:\n\n**Focused on Developer Experience:** We build tools for the engineering organization, freeing them up to creatively focus on business needs. We aspire to continuously iterate on tooling so that other engineers naturally adopt them, and we will ruthlessly throw away what isn't working well enough.\n\n**Revolution over Iteration:** We are looking to take giant steps forward and re-think older systems that have been gathering dust for too long.\n\n###   \nThe main ways you\u2019ll impact the business are:\n\n- **Team Leadership and Strategy.** You'll play a pivotal role in shaping the engineering culture and strategy. You'll collaborate closely with product managers, designers, and other engineers to set technical direction, make high-impact decisions, and ensure that the team is aligned with the company's objectives. Your insights will not only influence your immediate team but also contribute to the broader engineering vision at January.\n- **Technical Excellence.** You'll champion quality in every aspect of the development process. From developing simple solutions and writing unit tests to participating in design discussions and PR reviews, you'll ensure that the software we build is robust, scalable, and meets the highest standards of quality. You'll be responsible for identifying and addressing technical debt, ensuring that the codebase remains clean and manageable.\n- **Developing Peers.** When you work at January, you work with a team that grows together. Regardless of your current level, you\u2019ll share your knowledge of systems, engineering practices, and the problem domain, helping ensure everyone\u2019s success. You'll do this through code review, pair programming, documentation, and just plain being supportive.\n\nAs the company grows, you will be involved in scoping, architecting, and implementing new product lines. You\u2019ll have the opportunity to build new lines of business from scratch.\n\n### You might be a fit if you value:\n\n- **Genuine collaboration.** We recognize and explicitly reward feedback, alignment, and learning from each other.\n- **Managers as advocates.** You\u2019ll report to leaders invested in your growth and promotion, not just their own. Managers only succeed when their teams thrive.\n- **Outcomes over output.** We value finding ways to do more with less, working smart instead of burning out.\n- **Product ownership.** Engineers are owners, not mercenaries. Everyone plays a role in discovering, advocating for, and implementing product ideas.\n- **Technical quality.** We work collaboratively with our product team to ensure great outcomes without sacrificing quality. Sustainable development is a first-class priority.\n\n### What you bring to the table:\n\n- 2+ years of experience in software\n- Belief in creating tools that you would and *do* personally use, ensuring they address real-world needs.\n- Obsession with seeing things from the perspective of the user.\n- Experience with containerization technologies for development. (Docker)\n- Metric-oriented decision making.\n- Excitement for the opportunity to do hands-on user research and requirements gathering.\n- Interest in API design and full-stack web development. (GraphQL, Typescript, Python)\n\n**We are currently hiring for this position in our New York and San Francisco offices.**\n\nJanuary believes in doing its part to help close the wage gap that continues to plague much of the US workforce. We offer transparent and equitable compensation packages to all existing and future January team members.\n\nOur compensation range for the Software Engineer - Platform role is $115,000 to $155,000. We determine the final package by considering experience, applicable education and training, and relevant skills derived throughout our interview process.*This role also includes a competitive equity package, giving you a chance to feel true ownership of your work.*\n\nJanuary prioritizes the safety and well-being of our team members and, as such, requires all employees who work from or visit a January office to have proof of COVID-19 vaccination or provide a valid medical or religious exemption.",

That\u2019s because they\u2019re only a proxy for the real thing: *conversations*. Through a conversation, you can ask follow-up questions and get deep insights in a way that\u2019s fun for the interviewee. Except you can\u2019t have 1:1 conversations with everyone\u2026\n\nListen Labs has built an AI interviewer that can ask follow-up questions, like a conversation, but at the scale and ease of use of a survey.\n\n## **Technical Challenges**\n\n### **Turn qualitative data into quantitative insights**\n\nListen Labs clusters free-form conversation into a structured format. This is not a trivial task. We use embeddings, fine-tuned large language models, and more to solve these problems.\n\n### **Ask the right questions**\n\nHaving a great conversation is not trivial. We\u2019re fine-tuning and prompting in novel ways to get the right output from LLMs.\n\n### **Multi-modality**\n\nWe\u2019ve built the fastest speech-to-speech pipeline but there\u2019s a number of challenges we need to address to make it better. Our interviewer has audio input and output to the LLM and that\u2019s tricky to get right.\n\n## Investors\n\nThere\u2019s been $30B+ of market cap created from bringing surveys online. Our partner at Sequoia, [Bryan Schreier]([https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/bryan-schreier/](https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/bryan-schreier/)), was the first investor in Qualtrics \u2013 the $12B survey company.\n\n## About you\n\n- You love working on products end-to-end without detailed direction\n\n- You want to work in Next.js, TypeScript, and large language models\n\n- You are a collaborative builder and like to build systems with other engineers in mind.\n\n- You are an excellent written and verbal communicator.\n\n- You know when to seek assistance, and it's typically to discuss tradeoffs.\n\n- You don't scoff at unglamorous engineering tasks, yaks don't shave themselves.\n\n- Highly technical\n\n- Interested in building products end-to-end and owning the user experience\n\n- Excited about large language models\n\n### What we offer\n\n- $150,000 - $200,000 USD in cash.\n\n- High equity grant even for an early stage startup.\n\n- Work in person in our office @ 425 2nd St in San Francisco.\n\n",

But things are changing. A surge of technology companies are rising to the occasion and building products to solve the domestic challenges and national security threats we\u2019re facing today.  It\u2019s our job to help them be successful, and we\u2019ve raised from an incredible group of investors + have heavy-hitting national security veterans and technology industry advisors behind us to do it.\n\nObviant is a software-enabled marketplace to make it easier for companies to sell to government. We're leveraging data and AI to build tools that bring access and transparency to an opaque industry, with the government as the stakeholder that ultimately benefits. If you\u2019re excited about having an impact on the future of gov/defense, we\u2019re probably for you.\n\n**What We\u2019re Looking For** \nSomeone with previous experience as a full stack developer to help build our web app. Your work will lay the foundation for our product and you\u2019ll get to see it come to fruition. \n\nYou\u2019ll be the first hire on our team, get in on the ground floor, and have sizable ownership. As we grow, ideally you will too, both in the skills that you acquire as well as responsibilities.\n\n**The Day-To-Day** \n* You\u2019ll be responsible for building and owning features end to end. You have input on how it\u2019s built, what it looks like, and how it works.\n* Set the product roadmap and develop detailed documentation - including timelines and associated milestones\n* Understand customer needs to build a web platform experience that matches closely\n* Develop creative methods for scraping data from disparate online sources\n* Create a first-of-its-kind AI model for the government market\n\n** What You\u2019ve Done That We\u2019d Love **\n* 3+ years as a Full Stack Developer or similar role\n* You\u2019re relentlessly customer focused and enjoy interacting with them. You have a strong sense of empathy, making their problems your own, then building solutions to solve them.\n* Experience building and owning features end-to-end\n* Background working in government, govtech, defense/intel, or government contracting. (Though not required.)\n* Experience working in startups\n\n**Tech Stack Experience** \n* AWS\n* Full stack JavaScript - React, Typescript, and NodeJS\n* Postgres (or similar SQL)\n* Python (bonus)\n* Previous experience with or ability to learn new AI tools and models\n* Experience scraping data or desire to learn\n\n**Why We Might Love Working Together**\n* **You care about government** - We think our work is needed and benefits a system that impacts us all. \n* **Perseverance and endurance** - Hard problems are worth solving, and solving them can take a long time. There is no such thing as exhausting all options, it\u2019s just time to look for new ones. \n* **Empowerment &gt; micro-management** - We believe our job is simply to eliminate roadblocks for team members by equipping them with what they need to accomplish goals; we trust their judgment, skills, and experience from there. \n* **We\u2019re collaborative and communicate well** - Constructive dialogue that takes all viewpoints into account is the only way we get to the right decision. Respect, trust, and complete transparency with each other is critical - keep it all in the open\n* **You\u2019re *really* good at what you do\u2026 but it speaks for itself** - We\u2019re confident in what we bring to the table, but it comes without ego. Being humble is important to us\n* **You don\u2019t mind change and are comfortable with uncertainty** - We\u2019re deliberate about setting goals, but we\u2019re comfortable changing course and crawling through mud to get there. We\u2019re still figuring things out, and that demands being flexible and iterative.\n* **You like to move fast and have a bias towards action** - Our roadmap is directional at this stage - speed and a feeling of urgency is key to prove it out. We expect each other to proactively determine what needs to get done and just go for it. No waiting around.\n* **Work doesn\u2019t feel like \u201cwork\u201d to you** - We\u2019re passionate about what we\u2019re going after, and we devote more time to it than a typical 9-5. That often means putting in some extra time at night and occassionally on weekends . However, maintaining your own personal balance comes above all else, and you should establish that however you need to - flexible schedule, taking advantage of time off, or anything else you need.\n\n**The Details - Benefits &amp; Structure** \n* We\u2019re building a remote-first team eventually, but for founding team members, we have a strong preference for being located in the Washington, DC area in the early days.  \n* Competitive compensation + Sizeable equity - We\u2019re building something big, and you\u2019ll have ownership in that. This is ours.\n* Flexible vacation time - Use what you want, as long as you\u2019re taking care of what needs to get done. \n* Flexible schedule - We all have other things going on in our lives. Doctor visits, kids\u2019 activities, dog walks, take care of it whenever you need to. \n* Full health and benefits\n* And more\u2026\n\n**Our Values** \n* **Impact** \u2013 We have high conviction that our work matters and affects important outcomes. And we take a lot of pride in that. If we don\u2019t fix this, who will?\n* **Empathy** \u2013 Our customers\u2019 &amp; users\u2019 problems are our own. We\u2019re grateful for their trust, so we go above and beyond to show it - in both our work and our interactions.\n* **Straight Hustle** - We get stuff done, no matter what it takes.\n* **Integrity** -Transparency and respect comes above all else. It\u2019s non-negotiable. \n* **Humility** \u2013 We\u2019re not afraid to admit what we don\u2019t know, and we\u2019re constantly looking for ways to learn and grow.",
