They power everything from cars to rockets, sensors to servers, and have a crucial role to play in several major industries, making the $1T semiconductor industry a vital component of the global economy. However, designing modern semiconductor chips is a costly, engineering-intensive process, further worsened with archaic tools. With the rising complexity of chips, time and cost to market continues to rise.\n\nTo address this, we're reimagining how chips are designed using modern advancements in AI to reduce time/cost to market dramatically. With a growing number of organizations designing their own chips and the rising consumption of semiconductors in day-to-day life, the work you will do will significantly impact the lives of many. We are super excited about what we are building; come join us!\n\n**What are we looking for?**\nWe are looking for an exceptional Applied Research Engineer to join our founding team and contribute to improving our in-house large language models (LLMs). In this role, you will apply cutting-edge techniques to fine-tune LLMs and implement novel ways to improve their performance on our target applications.\n\nThis is a unique opportunity to work at the forefront of LLMs while surrounded by exceptional researchers and builders at AI2. As a founding member of a rapidly growing startup, you will significantly impact the product and shape its future. We offer competitive pay, benefits, and equity, and believe this position will be fulfilling for you.\n\n**Ideal Candidate**\nSeveral years of full-time experience in applied ML roles, preferably in a fast-paced environment like early-stage startups.\n\n**Non-negotiable**\n\n* Deep passion for technology. Self-driven individual with a sense of urgency\n* Detail oriented and a strong desire to build high-quality customer-focused products\n\n**Requirements**\n\n* Strong basics and understanding of Machine Learning/Deep Learning\n* Experience in building diverse and high-quality datasets and training deep learning models\n* Strong programming skills in Python\n* Familiarity with deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch\n* Exposure to or active participation in the latest research and advancements in NLP\n\n**Preferences**\n\nExperience in code generation with LLMs\nPrior experience in fine-tuning large language models desirable\nExperience setting up infrastructure for training large deep-learning models\n\n**Not Necessary**\n\nExperience in chip design great but NOT necessary\n\n**ABOUT US**\n\nWe are a small but passionate group with a mission to dramatically reduce the time, cost, and engineering effort needed to build complex silicon chips. Our founding team comprises of experts in chip design, AI, and modern software stacks. In past lives\u2014we were researchers, engineers, and leaders at major chip design/AI companies like Qualcomm, Nvidia, Facebook, Google, etc. We also count the Paul Allen Institute for AI as a co-founder, one of the world\u2019s leading A.I. research institutions. We recently raised a pre-seed funding round and are moving fast to build for our customers.\n\n**WHY JOIN**\n\nAs a funded startup, we also have several unique benefits that you can\u2019t really get anywhere else:\n\nPersonal impact \u2014 The opportunity to build something from the ground up and define a new product for an industry that is at the core of the modern technological revolution.\nAccess to unique learning opportunities \u2014 With the Allen Institute for AI (AI2) as a co-founder, our team gets access to numerous talks by leading AI researchers/paper authors, knowledge sharing amongst the community of hundreds of engineers working for AI2 companies, and much more. As a part of the multi-disciplinary team, you get to interact with people from very different backgrounds (from chip design to AI to software engineers).\nFounding title \u2014 You will be one of our first hires. For the rest of our days, no matter how many thousands of people join after you, you will always have that honor and distinction.\nEarly-stage equity \u2014 Early-stage risk comes with early-stage equity for you.

Companies today depend on Numeric's workflow and data platform to collaborate, monitor and analyze data, and share insights about their financials.\n\nWe believe an organization with up-to-date, accurate, rich financial data is empowered to move faster and smarter. Unfortunately, the tools and systems have not been keeping up. The complexity of work and granularity of data has ballooned, and old, slow software and simplistic tools only facilitate the manual work; they do little to solve the fundamental challenges of accounting and finance. As a product-focused company, we know that a great product and engineering team can build the tools to give our users superpowers. We work to free people from the manual and the tedious, and to bring delight to their work.\n\nNumeric is backed by Founders Fund, Long Journey Ventures, and others as well as founders from Ramp, Segment, and more.\n\n### **About the role**\n\nEvery engineer at Numeric is a product engineer. We believe the quality of a company's product is a direct reflection of its inclusion (or not) of engineers in every step of the product process. Ownership here means not only building, testing, and shipping your work, but also contributing to planning, scoping, and discovery. The role encompasses the entire loop of product iteration\u2013observing and learning from users, designing solutions, building, and repeating until we've exceeded users' expectations.\n\nPassionate builders improve through iteration, and learn by making mistakes. Our ideal candidate takes great pride in building and is excited by the ability to move fast. We place a great deal of emphasis on speed and ownership, and don't let anything get in your way.\n\n### Projects we're working on\n\nHere are a few projects you could get started with:\n\n- Building the transaction monitoring engine to spot anomalies and help our users pre-empt costly errors\n\n- Designing scheduling and automation of revenue and expenses\n\n- Improving our one-of-a-kind flexible search & reporting platform for financial data\n\n- Extending our real-time syncing integrations\n\n- Launching new workflow automations on our generalized task system\n\n### How we work\n\nThe engineering team here is a high-ownership, fast-paced, customer-focused group. We ship early & often. Deploys go out every day, and engineers ship & verify their own work. We keep things simple and do not incur operational cost or complexity until it's necessary. We stay grounded in our users and humble about what we don't know. We know that discovering the best solution is the result of an iterative, user-centric process. Finally, we move fast. With less than 2 years' time we're competing with existing players that have all been around for 10+ years.\n\n### About you\n\n- You thrive in a fast-paced and iterative environment. You are driven more by customer impact than technology.\n\n- When building software, you can find [the 80/20 solution to a problem](https://www.notion.so/An-80-20-rule-for-product-development-83def9a3359149d780cb4245d498a42a?pvs=21).\n\n- You're excited to build a new company, and to collaborate across all functions of the organization.\n\n- You're allergic to premature optimization in all its forms; you focus on the larger goals at hand.\n\n- The prospect of taking on incumbents as a small, high-performing team is an exciting challenge to you.\n\n- You thrive when given more ownership and responsibility.\n\n### Requirements\n\n- Computer science or other technical degree\n\n- 4+ years of experience in software engineering\n\n",
