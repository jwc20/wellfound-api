The same way everyone has a personal computer (now multiple personal computers), we have a thesis that everyone will have a personal database that augments them wherever they are, on whichever device they use.\n\nWe're creating the next generation tools for interpersonal computing, to help us make better sense of information and transform passive consumption into active thinking. That means we have to shed some traditional assumptions about UI affordances, and think way outside the box. We think of the interface as being like a game \u2013 where people can construct, navigate, and collaborate in their universes of knowledge. We need to model N-dimensional graphs (hypergraphs actually) comprised of interpersonal knowledge \u2013 in a way that a human being can understand.\n\nSome of these considerations are rather straightforward, like compositing and scaling browser windows into an integrated view with other components, or efficiently animating between different \u201cgame-states\u201d - but some of this role entails the invention (with team assistance of course) of totally new UI affordances, so that we can render the relationships between subgraphs using the entire gestalt toolbox, not just boxes, lists, and \u201ccanvases.\"\n\nWe are building for the web, desktop, and mobile environments. We love wasm, and we hope you do too.\n\n**You should be experienced with:**\n* Strong Typescript skills\n* Fearless with large codebases\n* Experience using Cordova / PhoneGap\n* Some experience with React\n* Some experience with MVC style architectures\n* Some Web assembly experience\n* Some Objective C experience\n* Good understanding of UX fundimentals\n\n**What's it like to work at Edvo? **\n\nWe're a lean team of seven and remote. We maintain core working hours of 9:30AM to 3PM Pacific, when we're all online and available at the same time. We strive to be clear in our communication and our foundation is based on trust and self-agency.\n\n**How to apply **\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in this role, reach out to Shireen at shireen@edvo.com and let her know what you\u2019re up to and why you align with Edvo. Feel free to share any relevant projects that you\u2019ve been working on. We\u2019re excited to meet you!",

                                        "description": "### The Role\n\nPut simply, engineers at Up&amp;Up solve the hardest problems in the business by whatever means get the job done most effectively. This is not your typical big tech software engineering role - as an engineer at Up&amp;Up, you\u2019ll be expected to own the solution to the most impactful problems in the business end to end, acting as your own PM, designer, and software architect. \n\nBy owning problems end to end, engineers at Up&amp;Up have an unprecedented opportunity to grow quickly with the company and lead mission critical parts of the business. If rapid growth, building new things, and ownership of challenging problems excite you, this is a perfect opportunity to jump straight into the deep end. \n\n\n**Job Description:**\n\n- Own the most impactful and challenging problems in the business from end to end\n- Make intelligent and pragmatic technical trade-offs in the service of getting results quickly\n- Design foundational technical systems from scratch\n- Write scalable, simple, readable, and well-tested code\n- Explore and implement new ways to deliver on our mission of building a fairer way to rent\n- Work side by side with our Operations, Finance and Real Estate teams to shine a fresh, technical light on their biggest pain points\n\n\n**Qualifications**\n*We\u2019re looking for candidates who have the following:*\n\n* Strong programming skills, ideally in Node JS/Typescript, Python, and/or a low level language\n* Ability to rapidly diagnose and structure large, ambiguous problems\n* A keen sense of the balance between technical complexity, first principles thinking, and implementation cost that best solves the problem at hand\n* Have broad understanding across the engineering stack\n* Learn quickly and are comfortable in a fast-paced environment\n* Understand that great engineering is a means to create world class products for our customers * the customer always comes first\n* Comfortable joining an in-person first culture (our office is located in Brooklyn, NYC)\n* Care more about getting to the truth than being right\n* Are unreasonably ambitious and excited to build something new\n* Are kind, positive, and optimistic\n* Love to proactively help/teach their teammates\n\n\n**Also nice to have:**\n\n*(Note: We are more interested in growth potential than prior experience for this role, so don't worry if you don't fulfill all (or any) of these additional criteria)*\n\n* Experience with machine learning and statistical modeling techniques\n* Experience incorporating Large Language Models into operational and technical workflows\n* Experience with data visualization, building dashboards\n* Experience with data engineering\n* Experience architecting and building large scale, mission critical technical systems\n* Experience with a lower level programming language such as C/C++/Java\n* Experience with the Google Cloud Platform\n\n\n**What You'll Get From Up&amp;Up:**\n\n* The opportunity to join a mission-driven company that is working on a novel solution to a major problem\n* A culture that prioritizes thoughtfulness, first principles thinking, and hard work\n* The chance to collaborate with a rockstar team with a diverse set of expertise across Engineering, Data Science, Real Estate, Finance, and Sales\n* Competitive compensation and thoughtfully designed perks\n* Comprehensive benefits (medical, dental, vision, commuter, 401k, etc)\n* Flexible vacation policy with required time off * we work incredibly hard but also encourage taking time off to relax, reflect, and do what you love outside of work\n* A vibrant office culture with frequent happy hours, team dinners, and other events\n\n\n### Background\n\n\u2190 **The Problem**\n\nAmerica is going through a housing affordability crisis, where access to ownership is growing increasingly out of reach. 33% of Americans are renting, and 25% of those that are renting spend over half of their income on rent. As a direct result, nearly 75% of Americans have less than $1,000 in savings. These numbers are projected to only get worse for future generations, as student debt and the cost of living continue to balloon.\n\n**Where Up&amp;Up Comes In \u2192**\n\nUp&amp;Up is building a new way to live where renters build wealth like owners.\n\nInstead of having a large portion of their cash stuck in a security deposit and making their landlords rich by paying off their mortgage, our renters have the opportunity to build wealth by sharing in the investment and generate the\u00a0exact same\u00a0returns as an owner. By paying rent on time and keeping property expenses low, renters can build their wealth each month and grow the value of their investment. At the end of their lease, renters can use the wealth they've accumulated to purchase the home or cash out and receive a check.\n\nYou can read more about how it works here:\u00a0https://upandup.co/how-it-works\n\nWe aim to unlock a decade of compounding wealth creation that will drastically change our customers\u2019 financial futures. To pull off this ambitious mission, we\u2019ve built an incredible early team and are backed by Founders Fund, Khosla Ventures, and strategic angels from Opendoor, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, and Millennium.
