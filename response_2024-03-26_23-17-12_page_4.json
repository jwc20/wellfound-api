Over the last 3 years, labor spend has increased &gt; 260% but revenues aren\u2019t keeping up. Optimizing existing labor resources and filling staffing gaps efficiently is a must for every health system, but current staffing and scheduling processes are broken and antiquated. Nursing leaders are spending 50% of their time on manual scheduling tasks, while staffing decisions typically come down to a combination of phone-tag and guesswork. \n\n**Vitalize Care\u2019s software enables health systems to optimize their labor resources and staff to real-time patient demand.** We project saving each hospital customers &gt; $2.5M in labor costs annually, while saving their frontline managers 2 - 3 hours/day in manual work by automating scheduling tasks. \n\nWe\u2019ve already closed multiple 6-figure contracts with top health systems and have begun our first enterprise hospital implementation. We\u2019ve raised $3.8M from Y-Combinator, Rebel Fund, Liquid2 Ventures, and healthcare angels including the CTO of Redox, CEO of Flexpa, CEO CareRev, and executives at top health systems.\n\n### \ud83e\ude93\u00a0**About the role**\n\nWe're hiring for a second Founding Engineer to join our team and contribute to all aspects of our product.

We have team members on the ground at our customer sites to actively collect feedback to inform product improvements.\n\n### \ud83e\udd47\u00a0**Skills:**\n\n- TypeScript, React, Postgres, Python\n- Stack: Next.js 14 w/ TailwindCSS, Supabase, Vercel\n- ***Nice to Have Experiences:*** passion for healthcare, startups, dev-ops, AWS\n\n### \ud83d\udccd Location\n\n- In-Person, Hybrid\n- San Francisco, CA \ud83c\udf09\n\n### \ud83d\udcb0 Compensation\n\n- $140K - 180K salary\n- 0.5% - 1.0% equity\n\n### \ud83d\ude4c  Benefits\n\n- Medical, dental, and vision insurance\n- 401k and 401k match\n- Unlimited PTO\n- Company retreats\n- Reimbursement for gym subscription (~$100 per month)\n\n**If interested, email team@vitalizecare.co with a resume and brief statement of interest!**",

We don\u2019t care where you went to school or whether we\u2019ve heard of your last company, just that you are technically excellent, learn quickly, and have an insatiable ambition to build something big. You are someone who loves to build complex products and systems from the ground up, and has a strong architectural sense. As a founding engineer you\u2019ll be wearing several hats - jumping into full stack feature implementation, product scoping discussions, and larger system architecture while playing a formative role in the direction and culture of the company.\n\n\n**About Stylar**\nStylar is building an AI-native fashion shopping platform. Instead of browsing a grid of foreign models, we\u2019re reimagining the online shopping experience to put you at the center. We use state of the art AI &amp; computer vision technology to generate outfits directly onto our shoppers, and help complete the journey by directing them to similar pieces at different brands and price-points. \n\n**Our Values:\nConfidence**\nStylar\u2019s mission is to inspire confidence by helping the world discover and own their style.

Companies live and die by delivering promised value to their customers. Startups even more so. At Stylar, we take commitments seriously and hold each other accountable for getting it done.\n\n**FIO mentality**\nEveryone runs into roadblocks, ambiguity, and bad luck. At Stylar, we\u2019re scrappy, resourceful players who embrace that part of the game and figure it out.\n\n**Think different**\nWhether style, upbringing, or product &amp; business strategy, Stylar embodies the unconventional. We\u2019re a team of designers, gamers, and martial artists building a paradigm-shifting fashion technology company; we constantly think outside the box to turn perceived weaknesses into strengths.\n\n\n\n**Requirements**\n* 2-3 years of experience shipping production grade full stack web applications in typescript\n* Strong sense of best practice programming principles in a fullstack monolith\n* Experience with distributed or general infrastructure - designing, architecting, implementation on inter-service communication\n* Can take point on feature design, scoping, delivery for the web app / mobile app\n\nNice to have:\n* Experience productizing applications of machine learning models\n\n**Our stack:**\n* Typescript full stack monolith\n* Next.JS Frontend\n* Node/Express REST API\n* Mongo DB Backend\n* Generative ML Models Built in Pytorch",
