We\u2019re a team of nearly 30 spread across the country, and we\u2019re on a mission to help Americans get out of debt.\n\nThe consumer debt crisis is at an all-time high ($17T) and most Americans live paycheck-to-paycheck. When people fall into debt, it\u2019s typically driven by scenarios outside of their control, and for many families, it can be incredibly difficult to navigate. We\u2019re here to help Americans manage their debt and give them the tools to succeed. We work closely with borrowers to help triage their financial situation, increase their credit score, and automatically negotiate their outstanding debts. We provide powerful and innovative tooling to both consumers and creditors to streamline repayment through the next generation of financial tooling.\n\nClerkie launched in 2018 and has significant financial backing from leading financial and venture institutions like Citi, Left Lane Capital, Wellington Ventures, Flourish Ventures, and Vestigo Ventures.\n\n**Culture:**\n\nEvery day, we obsess about how we can provide the best possible experience and outcome for our users. Our goal is to create a lasting business, one that uses true innovation to rethink the financial journey for Americans.\n\nWe\u2019re a group of hard-working professionals who are located across the US - 4 different time zones! We have a customer-first mindset and an appetite for getting stuff done. We\u2019re looking for a rock star Frontend Engineer to help us deliver life-changing solutions to those who need them most. \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**What we look for:**\n\n- You can pivot on the fly. Clerkie is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You\u2019re not looking for a boring job.\n- You have a \u201ccan do\u201d attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn\u2019t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.\n- You\u2019ve got positive energy. You\u2019re optimistic about the future and determined to get there.\n- You\u2019re never tired of learning.\n- You appreciate direct communication and look for feedback. You\u2019re both an active communicator and an eager listener.\n\n**Why work for us:**\n\n- Competitive salary + equity\n- Top-notch medical, dental, and vision\n- 401k\u00a0&\u00a0retirement benefits\n- Fully remote position\n- Fantastic coworkers\n- Annual destination company retreat\n- You\u2019ll have the opportunity to see how all aspects of the business operate and have the chance to be a part of a startup from the very beginning.\n\n**Job Description:**\n\nAs a React JS developer, you will be joining Clerkie\u2019s FE engineering team. Together, you will be focused on building Fiber, Clerkie\u2019s newest web app product. Fiber is a CRM designed with the goal of transforming America's debt industry.\n\nWe are looking for developers who are accustomed to finding solutions when there aren\u2019t clear answers available, have a strong understanding of front end development best practices, and have an ability to work in a fast-paced environment. If that sounds like you, we\u2019d love to hear from you!\n\nHere\u2019s what you will do:\n\n- Collaborate with our back end, product, and design teams to develop and launch Clerkie Fiber.\n- Code entirely in Typescript with Next.js.\n- Build responsive UIs with Tailwind CSS, focusing on aesthetic appeal and user experience.\n\nMinimum qualifications:\n\n- Bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science (CS) or a similar technical field of study, or equivalent practical experience\n- Strong JavaScript or Typescript skills with at 2+ years of experience in React.js\n- An eye for design and a passion for creating pixel perfect layouts\n- Standalone self-starter able to manage individual project priorities, deadlines and deliverables\n\nPreferred qualifications:\n\n- Excellent leadership, communication, and collaboration skills\n- Experience with designing RESTful APIs\n- Experience with building financial apps\n- Excitement for being a part of a small team where you will be expected to solve new challenges and learn new things everyday\n\nSalary range:\n\n- $90k - $150k (+ equity)\n\nAdditional compensation in the form(s) of equity and/or bonus are dependent on the position offered. Pay is based on factors such as (but not limited to) scope and responsibilities of the position, candidate's work experience and skill set, and location.\u00a0\n\n**Want to be a part of something bigger than yourself?**\n\nSubmit your resume and share why you are passionate about joining our team.\u00a0Clerkie is an equal opportunity employer and values diversity in the workplace.

We are backed by prolific and experienced venture capital firms like Founders Fund, Lux Capital, XYZ, Haystack, Human Capital, BoxGroup, etc., and have raised significant venture funding with strong early traction in both commercial aerospace as well as defense applications with the Department of Defense (DoD).\n\nThe Nominal team comes from commercial companies like SpaceX, Palantir, Anduril, Lockheed Martin, and NASA and is active amongst customers in aerospace, defense, industrial, and advanced energy applications (autonomous aviation, eVTOL/VTOL, flight testing, satellite development, etc.). We are also building and delivering solutions to the United States Air Force (USAF) who are looking to expand use cases across the broader DoD test community.\n\nOur product is a data visualization and computation platform designed to\u00a0accelerate how engineering teams test and validate\u00a0hardware systems. We specifically aim to shorten the data review process after running tests and helping engineering organizations scale testing campaigns more efficiently and effectively to save time and lower costs. It works by combining heterogeneous data into\u00a0runs\u00a0and allowing users to easily build custom visualization and analysis. Users write test logic with interactive computation, and these\u00a0checks\u00a0can be applied to historical and future runs to compound learnings. Data sources can include telemetry, sensor data, logs, simulations, and other testing metadata like environment, vehicle, part, version, etc.\n\nAs a Software Engineer at Nominal, you will be responsible for architecting and building end-to-end features and tooling, deploying them to users, and ensuring they meet user needs with a delightful UX and performance.\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80 About the role \n- Innovate at the cutting edge of data infrastructure, considering high frequency, high volume, streaming data with transformation and alerting capabilities\n- Design and build scalable APIs to power a low-friction user experience while fetching and transforming massive volumes of data\n- Help grow the team by sourcing, interviewing, and onboarding new engineers\n\n\n\ud83d\ude4c We\u2019d love to hear from you if you have \n- Experience developing and deploying infrastructure for high-scale- distributed systems or complex internal tools\n- Excitement to be a foundational member of the early team building software tools to amplify the capabilities of remarkable hardware engineering teams\n- Interest in occasionally traveling to spend time with end-users on-site (e.g. rocket test stands, spacecraft clean rooms, automated manufacturing facilities)\n\n\n\u26a1 Skills that supercharge us \n- **Relevant data technologies**: Apache Arrow, DataFusion, Flink, Beam, Kafka, D3.js, Superset, DuckDB, Plotly.js, TimescaleDB, QuestDB, Druid, Parquet, InfluxDB\n- **Modern technologies**: Typescript, Next.js, tRPC, Java, Wasm, WebGL, ZeroMQ, serverless functions, React, Postgres\n- **DevOps tools and infrastructure**: AWS, K8s, EKS, Helm, FluxCD\n\n\n\u2728  Benefits/Perks\n- Medical, dental, and vision insurance with 100% of premiums covered\n- Unlimited PTO /sick leave\n- Free lunch, snacks, and coffee\n- Learning stipend\n- Quarterly company retreats\n\n\nDon\u2019t meet every single requirement?

Our IDE extensions span 70+ programming languages and 40+ editors. Our state-of-the-art proprietary language models and custom inference stack allow us to deliver the best experience possible to our users. We've achieved substantial revenue and enterprise traction as proof of the quality and usefulness of our tools.\n\nWe're a small but experienced team that ships relentlessly. We welcome feedback to improve both our product and ourselves. We work hard, and we operate with a high degree of trust, agency, and ownership.\n\n## Challenges\n\n- How do we develop a code generation and editing system capable of solving many everyday developer tasks?\n\n- What's the next big interface after autocomplete and chat for interacting with AI?\n\n- How do we maintain reliability and scalability of our service across a wide range of IDEs, platforms, hardware, and programming languages?\n\n## What we're looking for\n\n(There are no hard requirements, as long as you can demonstrate you'll be able to write a lot of good code.)\n\n- Ability to learn and become an expert quickly.\n\n- A team player.\n\n- A self-starter. Hunger to dream up, plan, and execute tasks independently.\n\n- Ability to work across the stack (frontend, backend, IDE extensions, ML, infra, data).\n\n- Previous experience working with AI/ML, distributed systems, HPC, and systems/infrastructure is a plus.\n\n- Familiarity with AI-powered developer tools like Codeium, Copilot, ChatGPT, and others is a strong plus.\n\n## What we believe\n\n- Our best work is done in person. The team goes in 5 days a week into our office in [**_downtown Mountain View, CA_**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Q4DxMPr4vtFnkwEK8) (within walking distance of the Caltrain station).\n\n- Research is in service of a better product. While we read many papers, we won't have time to write them. The best AI researchers have excellent software engineering skills and know that infrastructure and evaluation work are critical.\n\n## Recent projects\n\nSome of the things that our engineers have worked on recently:\n\n- Regularly deploying an [**_autocomplete and chat product_**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Codeium.codeium) that scales to hundreds of thousands of daily active users.\n\n- [**_Codeium Live_**](https://codeium.com/blog/codeium-live): Chat in your browser with popular repositories.\n\n- An internal Kubernetes-native data processing framework to handle petabytes of data across thousands of spot CPUs.\n\n- A code attribution service for customers who want to ensure any generated code is licensed properly.\n\n- Instruction and edit fine-tuned models for [**_Codeium Command._**](https://codeium.com/blog/codeium-command-launch-announcement)\n\n- Model inference performance optimization using Nvidia CUTLASS, CUDA C++, and PTX assembly language.\n\n- Remote parsing, embedding, and indexing of users' codebases.\n\n",
